# Vietnamese Context-Sensitive Malicious Spelling Error Correction

"Spelling errors targeting specific keywords that users intentionally generate has seriously degraded the performance of social media control systems. In this paper, we show the severe effect of those misspellings and propose using a spelling correction approach for those targeted words based on context called word embedding. The data that we use within the limits of our work are Vietnamese spam email and hate speech. Also, we introduce a new and effective way to extract real misspellings to create reasonably synthetic data provided for our experiments. Our correction system results in a favorable performance on both synthetic and real data compared to Google."

The results of this paper are published at 2020 7th NAFOSTED Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS) (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9335909). And here is our source. However, this source code has had many modifications compared to the results published in the article to develop the problem.

* Note: The code may not be clean, we will re-arrange them in the near future
