# YOLO Object Detection

This is a hands-on exercise with the yolo v3 model of advanced computer vision.
First we will use the yolo model pretrain for object detection
Next we will improve the difficulty of the exercise by fine tuning the model with raccoon data for the raccoon detection task.
Finally, we will create manual data labels for traffic videos, and then build a vehicle detection and classification model in traffic video.
